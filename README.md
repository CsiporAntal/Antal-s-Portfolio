# Csipor Antal — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work as a PLC programmer and part-time web developer. It is based on the excellent [Nextfolio](https://github.com/1msirius/Nextfolio) template, a fast and minimal portfolio starter built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

> ⚠️ This is a **customized and personal** version of Nextfolio — not just a clone.
